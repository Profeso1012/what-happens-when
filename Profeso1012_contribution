### Detailed Explanation of HTTPS/SSL Process

When a secure connection is established between your browser and the server using HTTPS, the process involves several steps:

1. **Browser Request**: Your browser requests a secure connection by sending a message to the server.
2. **Server Responds**: The server responds with a copy of its SSL certificate.
3. **Browser Verification**: Your browser verifies the SSL certificate against a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
4. **Encryption Keys**: Once verified, your browser and the server create session keys for encryption.
5. **Secure Connection**: All data sent between your browser and the server is now encrypted and secure.

This process ensures that sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers are protected from eavesdropping and tampering.
